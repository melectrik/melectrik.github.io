title: Introduction - Yet an other blog
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

The Jekyll + Poole blogging technology paired with the beautiful github pages looks so minimalistic and efficient so that I have to give it a try.

There will be pots to different technology aspects and especially to devops and digital stuff.

Have a nice day ;-)
